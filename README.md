# PROJECT1_FYS-STK4155
### Repository for first project in FYS-STK4155: Applied data analysis and machine learning
#### Authors: Marius Helvig Havgar & Ã…smund Danielsen Kvitvang
In this project we study various regression methods, namely the Ordinary Least Square (OLS) method, Ridge regression and Lasso regression. The methods are combined with resampling techniques such as cross-validation. First, we tested the methods on created data and used this to fit polynomials to *Franke's function*. Then, we used real digital terrain data with the same methods.
