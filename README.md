# PROJECT1_FYS-STK4155
### Repository for first project in FYS-STK4155: Applied data analysis and machine learning
#### Authors: Marius Helvig Havgar & Ã…smund Danielsen Kvitvang
In this project we study various regression methods, namely the Ordinary Least Square (OLS) method, Ridge regression and Lasso regression. The methods are combined with resampling techniques such as cross-validation. First, we tested the methods on created data and used this to fit polynomials to *Franke's function*. Then, we used real digital terrain data with the same methods.

The repository consist of three part, namely a directory called *Programming*, a *report* and a zip-file containing the raw materials of the latex code. The directory contains two large Python implementations, one of which is a console menu for user friendliness and interactivity if the user wants to print out the results in a neat way. The other implementation consist of multiple plots as well as calculations.
